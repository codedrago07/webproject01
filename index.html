    Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan.<br> 
    Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.<br>
    [1] However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.<br>
     Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation.,<br>
     <br>
   

  
    The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917.<br>
     A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.<br>
      Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet.<br>
      In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games.<br> 
      It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.<br>

    Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies.<br>
     It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.<br>
     [2] Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.<br>
    [2] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[3]<br>

  Falling in love and struggling to progress towards—or maintain—a romantic relationship take priority, while other subplots either take backseat or are designed to develop the main love story.<br>
   The narrative focuses on the thoughts and emotions of the characters, illustrating the connections between them and explaining their reactions to events or conflict.<br>
   Almost always, the story ends happily and the couple is rewarded for their efforts with lasting love.<br>

  Well-made shonen anime (or shounen anime, as it is sometimes spelled) tend to be massive hits — just look at Attack on Titan or Dragon Ball.<br>
   It is by far one of the most popular "genres" of anime with countless numbers of manga adaptations and original series being created for fans.<br>
   Shonen is also a demographic rather than a traditional genre, so it covers a wide spectrum of shows.<br>
<br>
  In a category with countless anime to watch, it can be difficult to choose which series to get into.<br>
   Still, there are some shonen anime so excellent they stand above the rest and should be on every fan's must-watch list until they've seen them all.<br>
    What are the best shonen anime ever?<br>

<p class="five">
  Training for and participating in a sport take priority, with the goal of furthering one's athletic abilities—either to win a competition or achieve some social standing.<br>
   While the featured sport may be individual or team, the main cast will always overcome conflict through discussion and insights gained from other athletes or coaches.<br>
    This creates a general sense of collective support and achievement that is always present in Sports stories.<br>
  <br>

  Contrast with Action where the narrative is on resolving conflict with one's physical power. <br>
  While both Action and Sports may focus on exciting action sequencies, the two genres are mutually exclusive.<br>
